# Biography
 - Michael Solomatin: 2005, The Creator of EMERA very creative but bad at art, Business email: mike@emera.cat, Code in C#, NodeJS, PHP.

 - Yasin Davletyarov: 2005, open to new ideas, passionate about EMERA, sports, and innovation. I hope to grow and nurture our social service. Business email: yasin.dav@icloud.com 

 - Leonard Goman: 2005, Java simp and Minecraft degenerate. I know Java, JS, PHP,  HTML, and CSS.

 - Rayyan Khan: 2007, The original creator of the ILLUX concept. I know C++, C#, TypeScript/JavaScript, NodeJS, and all of front and back end. My level of programming (programming and coding are not the same) would be advanced. Email: xfaonae@protonmail.com

 - Mihail Milev: 2003, I know practically nothing yet but could be asking to run everything within a year if I seriously delve in and get obsessed. Though the latter is not guaranteed. I think of myself as pretty adaptable right now, knowledge-wise. In my free time, I learn about seemingly unrelated topics, sometimes for months to years at a time, usually with an ultimate goal or interest in optimizing a particular thing. Extremely open-minded and non-judgemental (like personally or morally). Also very honest, appreciate and value honesty from others very highly. I also try to be nice and get along. And perhaps contrary to what some might have heard or learned, I have found that if done properly, those are not mutually exclusive. Also, I think I can be a good critic because I am very, perhaps extremely, detail-oriented. Until I start getting ideas, at which point I hope I can also be of use in the creative department as well. I like my pov and ideas to be heard, and appreciate others trying to have an open mind as well. One of my interests was a Minecraft mod pack, so contact me if you wanna work on that. Or discuss anything from video game design, fitness/health, and bodybuilding/sports programming, to music theory, guitar tech, car tech, and philosophy, psychology, and politics.
